My first full code for swerve, not super consistent on updating as I will add code after i learn and understand it, 
the references I will be using are the 2023 Pure swerve code and 2024 Robot code for Apple Pi 2067.
If I end up using more sources (which I most likley will) I will add them to here
I also hope to integrate Advantage Scope to the code later on.
